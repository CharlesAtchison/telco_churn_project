### Project Obectives <a name='project_objectives'></a>
> - Create a Jupyter Notebook Report that shows processes and analysis with the goal of finding drivers for customer churn.
> - Within README.md file, include project description with goals, inital hypotheses, a data dictonary, project planning, instructions on how to recreate your project, answers to hypotheses, key findings, recommendations, and takeaways from the project.
> - CSV file with customer_id, probabilty of churn, and prediction of churn (1 = churn, 0 = not_churn). These predictions will be dervied from the best performing model on the test portion of the data. 
> - Any abstracted modules that are created to make the presentation more clean, during the acquistion and preparation of data.
> - Notebook walkthrough and presentation with a high-level overview of the entire project.

### Business Goals <a name='business_goals'></a>
> - Find drivers for customer churn at Telco. Why are customers churning?
> - Construct a machine-learning classification model that accurately predicts customer churn.
> - Document your process well enough to be presented or read like a report.

### Audience <a name='audience'></a>
> - Target audience is the Codeup Data Science Team.


### Deliverables  <a name='deliverables'></a>
> - A final report within Juypter Notebooks
> - A final report presentation using Juypter Notebooks
> - Modules necessary to recreate project
